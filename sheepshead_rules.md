# The Deck, Power, and Values

Sheepshead is played with a 32-card deck, made up of the ranks Ace, Ten, King, Queen, Jack, Nine, Eight, and Seven in each of the four suits (♣, ♠, ♥, ♦).  

The total point value in the deck is 120 points, which all players contest through tricks.  

**The values are distributed as follows:**  
- Ace (A): 11 points  
- Ten (10): 10 points  
- King (K): 4 points  
- Queen (Q): 3 points  
- Jack (J): 2 points  
- Nine (9), Eight (8), Seven (7): 0 points

# Trump Hierarchy

In the traditional “Wisconsin” game (the most widely played variant), the trump suit is Diamonds.  

**The full order of trump is:**  
- All Queens, ranked: Q♣ (highest), Q♠, Q♥, Q♦  
- All Jacks, ranked: J♣, J♠, J♥, J♦  
- All remaining Diamonds, ranked by card value: A♦, 10♦, K♦, 9♦, 8♦, 7♦

# Fail Suits (Non-Trumps)

The three non-trump suits are Clubs, Spades, and Hearts, excluding their Queens and Jacks (already trump).  

**Order of strength:**  
Ace (highest) > 10 > King > 9 > 8 > 7

# Dealing Rules (Sheepshead)

## Dealer and Direction
The role of dealer rotates clockwise each hand. The dealer shuffles and distributes the cards clockwise, beginning with the player to their immediate left.  

## The Blind (Widow)
In games that use a blind, it must consist of the correct number of cards for that game (e.g., 2 cards in the 5-player game).

## Completion Requirements
At the end of the deal, each player must have exactly the required hand size for that number of players (e.g., 6 cards each in the 5-player game). The blind must have exactly its required size. All cards in the deck must be accounted for with no extras or shortages.  

## Definition of a Legal Deal
A deal is legal if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:  
- Each player and the blind end with the correct total number of cards.  
- The entire deck is exhausted without error.

---

# Bidding

## Turn Order
Bidding begins with forehand (the player to the dealer’s left). Play proceeds clockwise, with each player in turn declaring either:  
- “Pick” — to take the blind and become the picker.  
- “Pass” — to decline.  

The first player to declare “Pick” ends the bidding immediately. That player is the picker.  

## If Everyone Passes (All-Pass Outcomes)
Different tables use different rules when no one picks. These should be agreed upon before play begins.  

1. **Leaster**  
   All players play for themselves. The goal is to finish with the fewest points.  
   - The blind is set aside and awarded to the last trick.  
   - To qualify as winner, a player must take at least one trick.  
   - If two or more players tie for lowest, the hand is a wash.  

2. **Doubler**  
   The hand is thrown in with no play. Each player contributes nothing further, but the next hand is played for double stakes.  
   - All scoring multipliers (Schneider, Schwarz, etc.) are doubled as well.  
   - If multiple all-pass hands occur consecutively, the doubling stacks unless the table decides otherwise.  

3. **Forced Pick**  
   If everyone passes, a designated player (commonly the dealer or the last player in order) is obliged to pick.  
   - The forced picker takes the blind and plays the hand normally.  
   - Some tables soften this rule by treating a forced pick as exempt from penalties (a “no blame” pick).  

4. **Mittler (Middler)**  
   Everyone plays individually, and the winner is the player whose point total ends up in the middle position.  
   - **Odd number of players (e.g., 5):** The winner is the player in the exact middle — for five players, the third-highest total. If there is no unique middle (for example, two players tie for third), the hand is declared a wash.  
   - **Even number of players (e.g., 4 or 6):** Since there is no single middle rank, the table must agree on which interpretation applies:  
     - Upper-Mittler — the lower of the two central scores (e.g., the 2nd-highest in a 4-player game).  
     - Lower-Mittler — the higher of the two central scores (e.g., the 3rd-highest in a 6-player game).  
   - Some groups allow the last player in bidding order to decide which interpretation applies before play begins.  
   - If there is no unique middle (ties), the hand is a wash.  

   **Blind Handling:** In Mittler, the blind is typically set aside and awarded to the last trick, preserving a total of 120 points. Some groups simply discard the blind.  

5. **Schneidster**  
   All players play for themselves. The goal is to score closest to 30 points without exceeding it.  
   - If multiple players tie, or if all players go over 30, the hand is a wash.  

6. **Pot Rules**  
   Each time all players pass, every player contributes one unit (chip, point, or agreed stake) into a central pot.  
   - The hand is thrown in and redealt by the same dealer.  
   - The pot carries over, accumulating with each all-pass.  
   - The pot is awarded in full to the winners of the next successfully picked hand.  
   - If the picker’s team wins, they take the pot; if the defenders win, they do.

# Partnerships

## 1. Partnership Determination
1. After **bidding** and the **bury** are complete, the picker must decide whether to:  
   - **Play with a partner**, by calling a specific card.  
   - **Play solo**, against all other players.  

2. Partnerships may be formed in two ways:  
   - **Called-Ace Partner System** (default, unless using fixed Jack-of-Diamonds partner rules).  
   - **Special cases**, such as forced Tens or solo play.  

---

## 2. Called-Ace Partner System

### 2.1 Base Rule
1. The picker must call the **Ace of a fail suit** (♣, ♥, or ♠).  
2. The **partner** is the player who holds the called Ace.  
3. The partner’s identity is revealed when the Ace is first played.  

---

### 2.2 Constraints
1. The picker may not call a fail suit in which they only hold the Ace.  
   - They must have at least one **non-Ace card** (a hold card) in the called suit.  
2. The picker may not call an Ace they already hold.  
3. The picker may not bury the called Ace.  

---

### 2.3 Timing
1. The call is made **after the bury**, before the first lead.  
2. Because the picker sees their full hand before calling, illegal calls (such as calling an Ace they buried) are not possible.  

---

## 3. Play Constraints

### 3.1 First Lead of the Called Suit
1. On the first trick where the called suit is led:  
   - The picker must play their **hold card**.  
   - The partner must play the **called Ace**.  
2. If the called suit is never led, the picker must play the hold card and the partner must play the Ace on the **final trick**.  

---

### 3.2 Validity Restrictions
1. The partner may only play the called Ace when that suit is led.  
2. The picker must retain their hold card until the called suit is led (or until the final trick).  

---

## 4. Corner Cases

### 4.1 Picker Holds All Three Fail-Suit Aces
1. The picker cannot call an Ace.  
2. Instead, they must call the **Ten of a fail suit** as partner.  
   - The picker must retain the corresponding Ace.  
   - When the suit is led:  
     - The picker plays the Ace.  
     - The partner plays the Ten.  
3. The picker must announce explicitly: *“Ten of [suit]”*.  

---

### 4.2 Picker Holds All Three Aces and All Three Tens
1. No card can be called.  
2. The picker must play **solo** against all other players.  

---

### 4.3 Ace Unknown (Hidden Partner)
1. If the picker calls an Ace but holds that Ace themselves, **and** they have no other card in that suit (only trump), the called Ace can never be led.  
2. Outcome:  
   - The partner’s identity remains hidden during play.  
   - At scoring, the called Ace is revealed and the partner is identified retroactively.  
3. **Table agreement required**:  
   - Treat this as a true partnership with a hidden partner until scoring, **or**  
   - Treat as a forced solo (partner never participates).  

---

## 5. Invalid States
- Picker calls an Ace they hold → invalid.  
- Picker calls a fail suit where they hold only the Ace → invalid.  
- Picker buries the called Ace → invalid.  
- Partner plays the Ace when the suit was not led → invalid.  
- Picker plays the hold card before required → invalid.  
- Any unresolved state not covered by rules → reject hand and redeal.  


---

## B. Jack-of-Diamonds Partner System

### Base Rule
The partner is always the player who holds the Jack of Diamonds (J♦).  

If the picker holds J♦ themselves, they must play solo.  

### Notes
- No called card is announced in this system.  
- The partner is revealed automatically when J♦ is played.  
- The blind and bury do not affect this system, other than possibly delivering J♦ to the picker.  

---

## C. Other Styles
- **Fixed Partnerships**  
  Teams are set in advance and remain constant. Bidding still determines who is picker, but no secret partner is chosen.  

- **Solo-Only**  
  The picker always plays alone against the field. No partnership rules apply.  

---

# Trick Play

Once partnerships are set (or solo is declared), play proceeds in a series of tricks. Trick play in Sheepshead has three fundamental requirements: following suit, respecting trump, and highest card winning.  

## Leading a Trick
- Forehand (the player to the dealer’s left) leads to the first trick.  
- Thereafter, the winner of each trick leads the next one.  
- Any card may be led: trump, fail, or point.  

## Following Suit
Players must follow suit if able.  

**“Suit” here means:**  
- Trump (all queens, jacks, and diamonds) is a single unified suit.  
- Fail suits are Clubs, Spades, and Hearts (excluding their queens and jacks).  

If a player has at least one card of the suit led, they must play one.  

If a player has no card of the suit led, they may play any card (trump or another fail).  

## Trumping
- Trump always beats fail suits.  
- If trump is led, all players must play trump if they can.  
- If a fail suit is led and a player cannot follow it, they may play trump — this is called trumping in.  

## Trick Winner
- If no trump is played, the highest card of the suit led wins the trick.  
- If one or more trump cards are played, the highest trump wins the trick.  

**Within suits, order of strength is always:**  
- Trump: Q♣ > Q♠ > Q♥ > Q♦ > J♣ > J♠ > J♥ > J♦ > A♦ > 10♦ > K♦ > 9♦ > 8♦ > 7♦  
- Fails: A > 10 > K > 9 > 8 > 7  

## Collecting Tricks
The winner of a trick collects all four (or five) cards and keeps them face down in a personal pile.  

Tricks are kept together until the end of the hand, when all points are tallied.  

---

# Special Notes

1. **Leading Trump**  
   The picker may lead trump immediately, even with the first trick.  
   Leading trump can “flush out” partners or force strong cards from opponents.  

2. **Called Card**  
   If the called ace (or Ten, in the fallback case) is led or played, it reveals the partner.  
   Until it appears, the partnership remains secret.  

3. **Sloughing**  
   A player unable to follow suit may discard a non-trump fail card.  
   This is called sloughing. It often occurs when a player wants to get rid of low-value cards that cannot win.  

4. **Overtrumping**  
   If a trump is played, later players may play higher trumps.  
   This is common when multiple defenders contest control of a trick.  

At the end of the hand, each team gathers their trick piles (including the picker’s bury) for scoring.  

---

# Scoring

After all tricks have been played, both sides tally their points. Scoring in Sheepshead always begins with the principle that there are 120 total points in the deck, and the picker’s team must score a majority to win.  

## Counting Points
Each side gathers the cards from the tricks they have won.  

The picker’s bury is added directly to the picker’s side.  

**Cards are tallied using their values:**  
- Ace = 11  
- Ten = 10  
- King = 4  
- Queen = 3  
- Jack = 2  
- Nine, Eight, Seven = 0  

Total must equal 120 points across both sides.  

## Winning Thresholds
- Picker’s Side Wins: if they score 61 points or more.  
- Defenders Win: if the picker’s side scores 60 or fewer.  

## Degrees of Victory
Sheepshead tradition recognizes several levels of outcome:  
- **Simple Win:** Picker’s side has 61–89 points.  
- **Schneider:**  
  - If defenders are held to 30 or fewer points, they are in Schneider.  
  - If picker’s side is held to 30 or fewer, they lose in Schneider.  
- **Schwarz:**  
  - If one side takes no tricks at all, they are Schwarz. Rare, but decisive.  

## Multipliers and Stakes
Most scoring systems use multipliers to adjust stakes based on the margin of victory.  

**Common rules:**  
- Base Value: A picked hand is worth 1 unit (chip, point, agreed stake).  
- Schneider: Doubles the value.  
- Schwarz: Triples the value.  
- Doubler (if using that all-pass rule): Doubles the entire settlement again.  

**These can stack.** For example: if a hand was doubled by a previous all-pass, and the picker lost in Schneider, the defenders would each collect 4 units.  

## Partnerships and Payment
- **Picker and Partner Win:**  
  Defenders each pay the picker (or the picker + partner, depending on house style).  
  Settlement may be split evenly between picker and partner, or weighted more heavily toward the picker.  

- **Defenders Win:**  
  The picker pays each defender. If the picker had a partner, that partner may share in the loss, or may be exempt, depending on house rules.  

## Solo Hands
If the picker plays solo (with no partner), stakes are often multiplied — usually doubled.  
The picker then wins or loses against all defenders individually.  

## Pot Rules
If the table uses a pot system for all-pass hands:  
- The winning side of the next picked hand also claims the accumulated pot, in addition to standard payments.  
- If the picker loses, they may also be required to contribute to the pot, depending on house rules.
